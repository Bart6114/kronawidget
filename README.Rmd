# kronawidget

## Installation

Install the package using `devtools`. This requires you to have the `devtools` package installed.

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github('dataroots/kronawidget')
```

## Example dataset

An example dataset for testing purposes is included in the package. You can load this dataset as follows.

```{r}
# load test dataset
data(testdata, package = 'kronawidget')

# get a peek
head(testdata)
```

## Constructing a krona data object

The KRONA library uses an XML data representation. In order to use a `data.frame` as input, one first needs to convert it to a KRONA compatible shape using `df_to_krona`. Have a look at `?df_to_krona` to better understand the arguments to be passed to the function.

```{r}
library(kronawidget)

testdata_doc<-
  df_to_krona(df = testdata,
              name = "testdata",
              magnitude = "area",
              "country", "river.basin.district", "first.stressor", "second.stressor")
```

As the `df_to_krona` function is quite heavy from a computational point of view, there is also a `df_to_krona_cached` function available, which wraps the `df_to_krona` into a memoization layer (using the `memoise` package).

## Stand-alone use

The stand-alone use of the visualization is rather straightforward:

```{r, eval=F}
kronawidget(testdata_doc)
```


## Shiny app integration

In order to use the KRONA visualization inside of a Shiny app the following functions are available:

- `renderKronawidget` (check `?renderKronawidget`): used in order to actually generate a KRONA graph in the server-side of your app. You can e.g. use the example defined under 'stand-alone usage' and encapsulate it in the `renderKronaWdiget`.
- `kronawidgetOutput` (check `?kronawidgetOutput`): which renders the output in the UI part of your app
