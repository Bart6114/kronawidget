# KRONA specific

- forced viz to reside in div container
- forced mouse position calc within div container
- KRONA uses a lot of global variables to maintain state, therefor difficult to use multiple graphs in one app
- function poluted global namessplace making it impossible to update the graph dynamically, encapsulated in a function
